# üêç Python Playground

## Why this repo exists.

I don't know much about `Python` so I figured **nows a good a time as any** to learn. Creating this repo as a way to track my progress with learning Python.

Coming into Python as a JavaScript developer, I am very curious to see the similarities & also where the languages differ.

## Goals.
**My goals with learning Python include**:

* primarily web development
  * api, server development, ect
* eventually work with AI
* broadening my skills as a developer to better land a job
